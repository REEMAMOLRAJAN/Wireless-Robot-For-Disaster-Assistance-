//Wireless-Robot-For-Disaster-Assistance-
//The robot is a great aid for disaster management. This robot is controlled via a webpage developed using HTML and PHP. We can
monitor the disaster-affected area through the camera fixed on our robot. If it detects any victims using the PIR sensor the location will be mailed to the rescuers.

//The project is divided into 3 different parts.


The robot uses Raspberry Pi model 3+ as its processor.
//Robot fetches location using Neo 6m GPS. The only issue with the GPS is that sometimes it fails to catch a signal when placed indoors and it is a cloudy day. 
//The built-in wifi of Raspberry Pi serves the purpose.



//The OpenCV library helps to acquire live feed from the accident location.
