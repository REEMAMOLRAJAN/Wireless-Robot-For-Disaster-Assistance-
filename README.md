moniter the disaster affected area through the camera fixed on our robot. If it ditects any victims using PIR sensor the location will be mailed to the rescuers.

The robot uses Raspberry Pi model 3+ as its processor.
//Robot fetches location using Neo 6m GPS. The only issue with the GPS is that sometimes it fails to catch signal when placed indoors and it is a cloudy day.
